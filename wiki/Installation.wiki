#summary How to install this addon in Spring Roo
#labels Phase-Deploy

You can install the addon in Roo 1.1.0 like this (tested with RC1 and STS 2.5.0.RC1):

At first edit conf/config.properties of your Roo installation to add http://spring-roo-equals-roo-addon.googlecode.com/svn/maven-repository/repository.xml as OBR repository there:

{{{
felix.log.level=1
felix.auto.deploy.action=install,start
obr.repository.url=http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/repository.xml.zip http://spring-roo-equals-roo-addon.googlecode.com/svn/maven-repository/repository.xml
}}}

Now open a Roo shell and type:

{{{
osgi obr start --bundleSymbolicName de.saxsys.roo.equals.addon
}}}

_ Note: There may be some issues with this when using Roo shell within STS. For instance, with STS 2.3.3.M2 the addon disappears when restarting STS (since the OSGi bundle cache is hold in a temp folder) and you have to repeat the command above to install it again. We suggest to use at least STS 2.5.0.M3, since there those issues seem to be fixed._

You can verify that the plugin is active by typing:
{{{
osgi ps
}}}

You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  53] [Active     ] [    1] Spring Roo - Addon - equals() and hashCode() (1.1.0)
}}}

Next step: See [Usage how to use] the equals addon.
