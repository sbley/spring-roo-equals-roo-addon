#summary How to install this addon in Spring Roo
#labels Phase-Deploy

Thanks to `RooBot`, the installation is as simple as this (tested with RC1 and STS 2.5.0.RC1):

{{{
addon install --bundleSymbolicName de.saxsys.roo.equals.addon
}}}

Now you can verify that the plugin is active by typing:
{{{
osgi ps
}}}

You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  53] [Active     ] [    1] Spring Roo - Addon - equals() and hashCode() (1.2.0)
}}}

Next step: See [Usage how to use] the equals addon.
