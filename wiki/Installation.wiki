#summary How to install this addon in Spring Roo

You can install this plugin into Roo 1.1.0.M1 by executing the following commands in the Roo shell (Hint: Roo code completion works for  everything below except from the URLs):

  # osgi obr url remove --url http://felix.apache.org/obr/releases.xml
  # osgi obr url add --url http://spring-roo-equals-roo-addon.googlecode.com/svn/maven-snapshot-repository/repository.xml
  # osgi obr start --bundleSymbolicName de.saxsys.roo.equals.roo.addon

_ The first step is required since felix OBR currently causes errors during bundle installation in Roo. Later it might be omitted_

Now you can verify that the plugin is active by:
  * osgi obr ps

You should see something like:
